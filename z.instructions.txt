dropdown isnt showing other option, only "No COndition"
other options neeeded to to appear
nothing fixed, read the previos commands what i wanted

previous command:
look here
view: App_Status\views.py
template file: templates\App_Status\status.html

task , u have to change the search system a bit.
u can see there is already a search system is implemented, but u need to change implemented

there is 6 critereia in drop down at present as u can see:

                <option value="All" selected="">All</option>
                <option value="Package ID">Package ID</option>
                <option value="Item Name">Item Name</option>
                <option value="Warehouse">Warehouse</option>
                <option value="Unit">Unit</option>
                <option value="Entry/Update date">Entry/Update Date</option>
 we dont need All now.
 search system will like:
 there will be 6 boxes in dropdwn and 5 input field to receive value for each dropdown ("No Condition won't have any input field, just dropdown)
  dropdown boxes are:No Condition, Package ID, Item Name, Warehouse,Unit, Entry/Update Date


  

 1. at first each box will select the values at "No Condition"=> it means "Select * from Item"
  and only first box will be visible first

2. if first box is selected any value from drpdwn 3 things will happen.
    lets say someone selected "Unit" as first dropdown.then, after pressing search button
    a. query will be "select * from Item where Unit=<value from input box for unit>"
    b. 2nd box  will appear
    c. the dataGridView panel will show the current result of query

3. Now for 2nd deropsown:
  a. dropdown will show the boxes but not the boxes which was previusly selected(in the example it will not show unit)
      so it will now show 4 criteria 
  b. lets say now user slects "Warehouse", 
      query will be "select * from Item where Unit=<value from input box for unit> and Warehouse=<value from input box for unit>"
  c. after pressing enter the dataGridView will show the query result of above query in dataGridView
  d. 3rd box will appear


4. this cycle will continue for all 5 boxes

note: if user selects "Entry/Update Date" date dropdown, input box will be datepicker

u can only edit  App_Status\views.py, templates\App_Status\status.html in these files and urls.py if necessary

u can use bootstrap4 and fontawesome to design

implement it,
dont have to print output in zz.output.txt
